# Skyrim-like command-line RPG

This is a starting project with a goal of creating a complex open-source, multi-platform command-line RPG in the style of The Elder Scrolls. The game should play like an interactive book but also provide an extrem freedom and non-linear gameplay. I have decided to drop all graphics and sounds for the sake of creating a quality RPG core engine, upon which others can potentially build in later phases of the project - I can for example imagine someone making a nice GUI wrapper later.

Anyone can contribute to the project by forking the repository, doing some work and issuing a pull request. To get an idea of what's needed to be done see the document linked below.

More detail and important info (group chat link, reccomendations, concepts etc.) about the project can be found in the following document that is being constantly updated:
